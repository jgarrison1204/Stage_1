      <h2><u>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web</u></h2>
        <div class="section-concept">
        <div class="section-title">
          How the web works:
        </div>
          <p>
            There are three major components that makes the web work.
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li><em>Client</em> - computer and browser. Like the one I'm typing on.</li>
            <li><em>The Internet></em> - Nuff said.</li>
            <li><em>Servers</em> - big computers that store whole bunch of info.
              <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>Here is a good video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQQA8RpKxqg">servers.</a></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

      <div class="section-title">
        HTML:
      </div> 
        <p>
          HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> All web pages are built on HTML and that's why it's important
          to learn.
        </p>

        Tag and Elements:
      </div>
        <p>
          HTML documents are made up of these things called <b>elements</b>. <b>Elements</b> are written with a <b>start</b> tag, an <b>end</b> tag and
          <b>content</b> in between.  Here is a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp">link</a> about elements.<br>
          And here are some of the tags we've talked about so far:
          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li> <b>&ltdiv&gt</b> - creates a box that can hold content and other tags.</li>
            <li> <b>&ltp&gt</b> - stands for paragraph and is a <b>block element</b> that creates margins before and after each tag.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section-concept">
      <div class="section-title">
        Computers are stupid:
      </div>
        <p>
          There is a really <strong>cool</strong> way we explain why computers are stupid to kids.  I heard this on a podcast once. Have a
          teacher pretend to be a <em>computer</em> that has to make a PB and J sandwhich. The teacher takes literal orders from the kids and
          makes a mess of things.  The kids <b>learn</b> that telling a computer to make a sandwhich is a complex and detailed task.
        </p>
      <div class="section-title">
        Inline vs Block Elements:
      </div>
        <p>
          HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>.  The difference is that <em>block</em> elements have an "invisble box" around them
          used to format the element.

      <div class="section-title">
        How websites work:
      </div>
        <p>
          Three main languages are used to make responsive websites.  Think of it like building a house.
          <ol type="1">
            <li><b>HTML</b>: which is like the structure of the house.</li>
            <li><b>CSS</b>: which is like the style of the house (e.g. what color are the walls).</li>
            <li><b>JavaScript</b>: which is like changing an element of the house (e.g. garage door opener)</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section-concept">
      <div class="section-title">
        DOM:
      </div>
        <p>
          Document Object Model -  a tree structure that is like the blue print for a webpage that can interact with elements in HTML.
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">link</a> to a wiki-article on DOM.</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="section-title">
        Everything Is A Box:
      </div>
        <p>
          <span>HTML uses boxes for layout and structure.</span> Boxes are also useful for translating a design into code. They also make it easier to rearrange the layout on a website.
          It’s a good idea once you get a mock-design to spec out how many boxes you want to use to design the page.
          Use <b>&ltdiv&gt</b> tags to create “boxes” in HTML. Here is a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp">resource</a> for understanding div tags a bit better.
